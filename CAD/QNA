Q:Why rack and pinion?
A:Only way I can think of that translate rotational motion of the servo to translational motion.

Q:What happen to the small linear actuator?
A:It doesn't give enough torque.

Q:What are the setting and material of the 3d printed parts
A:cheap PLA filament, 183 degree extrusion, 68 degree bed, .25mm layer height, 15% infil

Q:Why don't you bump up infill to get rid of flex?
A:You can but I am mostly concern on fit at the time.

Q:What file should I download to print or modify the parts?
A:STL if you just want to print, SLDPRT if you have solidworks and want to modify files, STEP if you have fusion360 or other CAD software

Q:What printer and slicers were you using?
A:Tronxy P802MA, simplify3d

Q:Jaw of servo adapter kept breaking, what to do?
A:Easiest way is to print it at a different X/Y angle so the no stress is put on layer adhesion. Downside is it requires more support material and longer print time.
Or simply increase the distance of the jaw opening in CAD
