1. Try to use a different sensor, there are multiple sensor you can choose from on https://www.co2meter.com/products/
    I would try the SprintIR next since it offers quick respose and have small air port.
2. try the Sample Draw Tube Cap and Sample Draw Pump Kit from co2meter.com with GC-0020/22, cut holes on the rubber seal and epoxy tube onto it.
    The benefit of this is that the sensor is "off-side" and it wouldn't be affected by light or temperature inside the chamber as much. 
3. If the rack and pinion system is not working out for large torque, try to find a way that uses lead screw.
